# Grocery Store Inventory System

### Stephen Shuecraft/Zhen Ze Ong/Ze Sen Tang/Kashia Ly

Final group project for a Data Modeling & Application Project class. We designed and created a simple database for an imaginary grocery store using MySQL Workbench. We then made a local webpage using HTML that allowed a user to retrieve and update data. The database contains sample employee, customer, product, supplier, and transaction data. We then made queries and updates on the database to test its functionality.
